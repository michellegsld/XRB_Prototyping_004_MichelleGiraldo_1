## About

This is my Week 1 portfolio project created for the XR Bootcamp Prototyping course.

Essentially, a wall is moving towards the player where they have to try to
fit through a hole in the wall so they don't get hit.


## Todo

**Current Goal:** Implement a way to restart the game.

**Next Goal:** If there's enough time, find a way to implement difficulty selection.
Else I will just add a few plain materials for easier visual cues.

*10/26 9:36AM -* Completed Timer and Lives Stretch goals. Also implemented Win/Lose.
Now I just want to find a way to add an actual restart button... should I make a
button appear in front of the player to restart after the game ends? Not sure if
I will have time to do difficulty but I can make those buttons as well.
