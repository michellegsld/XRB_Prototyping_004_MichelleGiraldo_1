## About

This is my Week 1 portfolio project created for the XR Bootcamp Prototyping course.

Essentially, a wall is moving towards the player where they have to try to fit through a hole in the wall so they don't get hit.

## Todo

**Goal:** Create at least 10 different walls so tomorrow morning I can get started on the player's colliders.

*10/25 1:06AM -* Currently creating the holes to cut out of the walls in order to create the "randomized" list. So far I have one outline.
