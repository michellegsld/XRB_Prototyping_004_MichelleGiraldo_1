## About

This is my Week 1 portfolio project created for the XR Bootcamp Prototyping course.

Essentially, a wall is moving towards the player where they have to try to
fit through a hole in the wall so they don't get hit.


## Todo

**Current Goal:** Finish adding Colliders to the walls and then randomize their spawn.

*10/25 1:22PM -* Completed detection of player and play area! It turns out the walls
lost their colliders after using the ProBuilder Experimental Boolean Tool to cut the
hole out. This means I need to add colliders to the walls and outline the shape for
the player to go through. Then I will flesh out the spawning of walls and randomly
choosing which one to be in play.
