## About

This is my Week 1 portfolio project created for the XR Bootcamp Prototyping course.

Essentially, a wall is moving towards the player where they have to try to
fit through a hole in the wall so they don't get hit.


## Todo

**Current Moment Goal:** Create at least 10 different walls so tomorrow morning I can get started
on the player's colliders.

*10/25 1:06AM -* Currently creating the holes to cut out of the walls in order to
create the "randomized" list. So far I have one outline.

*10/25 1:15AM -* **IDEA Note for** *"Create Way to Spawn More Walls On Pass"* **:**
Create a collider for the play area. If wall is detected in it then the wall is
currently passing the player... if it makes it past the play area then the wall can
be removed or "put away". Then a new wall can be spawned or "sent out".
