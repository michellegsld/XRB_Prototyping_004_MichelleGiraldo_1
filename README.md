## About

This is my Week 1 portfolio project created for the XR Bootcamp Prototyping course.

Essentially, a wall is moving towards the player where they have to try to
fit through a hole in the wall so they don't get hit.


## Todo

**Current Goal:** Add Comments to Code.

*10/26 12:12PM* Finally figured out how to set up OBS and record the game. It took me a bit to upload it.
