## About

This is my Week 1 portfolio project created for the XR Bootcamp Prototyping course.

Essentially, a wall is moving towards the player where they have to try to
fit through a hole in the wall so they don't get hit.


## Todo

**Morning Goal:** Try to make more Left and Right walls, else start with player
collider and it's interaction with the walls.

*10/25 4:16AM -* Hoping off now, will resume in the morning. Unity keeps crashing
when I try to use ProBuilder and the Experimental Boolean Subtraction between the
MovingWallTemplate and Shape8 on the Left side.

*10/25 1:15AM -* **IDEA Note for** *"Create Way to Spawn More Walls On Pass"* **:**
Create a collider for the play area. If wall is detected in it then the wall is
currently passing the player... if it makes it past the play area then the wall can
be removed or "put away". Then a new wall can be spawned or "sent out".
