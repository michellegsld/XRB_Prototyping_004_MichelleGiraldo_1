## About

This is my Week 1 portfolio project created for the XR Bootcamp Prototyping course.

Essentially, a wall is moving towards the player where they have to try to
fit through a hole in the wall so they don't get hit.


## Todo

**Current Goal:** Add a timer and lives on the wall. Do within 10 minutes as I have to wrap up.

*10/25 4:50PM -* Walls now randomly selected when they spawn and disappear once they pass
the play area. A wall won't spawn if the player isn't detected and the final piece to add
are lives and a timer.
