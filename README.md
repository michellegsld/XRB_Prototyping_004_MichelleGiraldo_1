## About

This is my Week 1 portfolio project created for the XR Bootcamp Prototyping course.

Essentially, a wall is moving towards the player where they have to try to
fit through a hole in the wall so they don't get hit.


## Todo

**Current Goal:** Work on Player colliders with moving wall.

*10/25 1:00PM -* The MovingWallTemplate now moves past the PlayArea and is detected
when it collides with it's mesh collider. This has been done using Triggers on the
MovingWallTemplate. Now to test out a wall with a hole and it's detection with
a player.
